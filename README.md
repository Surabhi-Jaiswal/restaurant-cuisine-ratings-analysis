Restaurant Cuisine Ratings Analysis üçΩÔ∏è

## Project Overview

This project performs a high-level **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on restaurant cuisine ratings. The dataset contains customer preferences for various cuisines based on multiple demographic factors like **gender, profession, marital status, budget**, and **alcohol consumption**. The goal is to uncover insights that can help restaurants understand customer behavior better and tailor their services accordingly.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about customers' demographics and their cuisine preferences, including:

- **User ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Area Code**: Area code of customer residence.
- **Location**: City and area of customer residence.
- **Gender**: Gender of customer.
- **Year of Birth (YOB)**: Year customer was born.
- **Marital Status**: Whether the customer is married or single.
- **Activity**: Customer profession (student or professional).

- **Cuisines**: Cuisine preferred by the customer.
- **Alcohol**: Frequency of alcohol consumption.

### Data Source

The dataset was provided by [Anirudh Kalabande](https://github.com/anirudhk08) and is shared within the data science community.


## Key Insights

Some of the main questions explored in this project:

1. Cuisine Preferences by Gender: How do male and female customers differ in their cuisine choices?

2. Budget vs Cuisine: What relationship exists between the budget and the type of cuisine preferred?

3. Customer Ratings by Profession: Do students and professionals rate their dining experiences differently?

4. Alcohol and Food Ratings: How does alcohol consumption affect cuisine ratings and preferences?

5. Marital Status and Preferences: Is there a difference in cuisine preferences between married and single customers?


## Visualizations

This project uses a variety of data visualizations to make insights clearer and actionable:

- Cuisine Preferences by Gender: Bar chart showing the most liked cuisines by gender.

- Budget vs. Cuisine: Scatterplot showing the relationship between customer budget and their cuisine preference.

- Customer Ratings by Profession: Comparison of ratings by professionals and students.

- Alcohol Consumption and Cuisine Ratings: Pie chart of alcohol consumption and its effect on food ratings.

- Marital Status & Preferences: Visualizing how marital status impacts cuisine selection.
